# wl-pprint

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shayan-najd/wl-pprint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shayan-najd/wl-pprint)

This is a pretty printing library for Idris based on Phil Wadler's paper _A
Prettier Printer_ and on Daan Leijen's extensions in the Haskell `wl-pprint`
library. See the IdrisDoc for specific documentation:
```
idris --mkdoc wl-pprint.ipkg
```

Originally authored by Daan Leijen, the code has been ported to Idris by Shayan
Najd and David Christiansen.

If you have issues or suggestions, please send pull requests or open issues on
this repository.

To run what rudimentary tests are present, type `idris --testpkg wl-pprint.ipkg`.
